Then, take necessary arguments related to the selected operation and execute the respective method. Finally, the program must exit with status code 0, when 0 is provided as a choice.

Output Format:
- each output should be in new line
- use 'boolalpha' to output booleans, eg: cout << boolalpha << dq.pop_front() << endl;
